# Bankruptcy-Prediction-with-ML

Context :

This GitHub repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict the likelihood of a company going bankrupt using financial data. The dataset used for this project includes information such as financial ratios, and historical performance data. The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

The project includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the process of cleaning and preparing the data, selecting and training a model, and evaluating its performance. The project also includes Python scripts for loading the data, training and evaluating the model, and making predictions.

The model is built using popular machine learning libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn. The project utilizes several algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine to evaluate the best fit model.
